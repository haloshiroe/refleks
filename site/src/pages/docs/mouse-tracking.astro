  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    RefleK's can record your mouse movements during KovaaK's scenarios. Replay
    your runs, analyze your mouse paths, and get insights into your aiming
    patterns.
  </p>

  <div class="image-container">
    <img
      src="/assets/images/mouse_big.webp"
      alt="Mouse movement analysis"
      loading="lazy"
    />
  </div>

  <h2>Enable Mouse Tracking</h2>
  <p>Mouse tracking is disabled by default. To enable it:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open Settings (gear icon)</li>
    <li>Go to General → Mouse Tracking</li>
    <li>Toggle it on</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>When mouse tracking is enabled:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      RefleK's maintains a rolling buffer of mouse movements while KovaaK's is
      running
    </li>
    <li>
      Mouse position is captured at high frequency using Windows Raw Input
    </li>
    <li>
      When a scenario ends, the relevant portion is extracted from the buffer
      and saved with your run
    </li>
    <li>Data is stored locally with your run stats</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="warning">
    <strong>Anticheat Warning:</strong> Mouse tracking uses low-level Windows input
    APIs (Raw Input). While this is safe for KovaaK's, some kernel-level anticheats
    in other games may flag this type of input monitoring. If you play games with
    aggressive anticheats (like Vanguard or FACEIT), consider disabling mouse tracking
    or closing RefleK's before launching those games.
  </div>

  <h2>Playback & Analysis</h2>
  <p>After a run, you can view the recording:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Replay:</strong> Watch your mouse path with play/pause controls
    </li>
    <li><strong>Speed control:</strong> Slow down or speed up playback</li>
    <li><strong>Scrubbing:</strong> Jump to any point in the recording</li>
    <li><strong>Path visualization:</strong> See your entire mouse path</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Automatic Insights</h2>
  <p>RefleK's automatically analyzes your mouse movements:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Overshoots:</strong> When you move past the target</li>
    <li><strong>Undershoots:</strong> When you don't reach the target</li>
    <li><strong>Inefficient paths:</strong> Curved or wobbly movements</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sensitivity Training Suggestions</h2>
  <p>
    Based on your overshoot and undershoot patterns, RefleK's suggests a <strong
      >training sensitivity</strong
    > to help you improve:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Frequent overshoots:</strong> Suggests a <em>higher</em> sensitivity
      to train with smaller, more controlled movements
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Frequent undershoots:</strong> Suggests a <em>lower</em> sensitivity
      to train with larger, more confident flicks
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This is counterintuitive by design - the goal is to train your muscle memory
    to compensate for your current weaknesses. After 5-10 runs at the suggested
    sensitivity, switch back to your normal sens. You'll likely find your
    movements more refined.
  </p>

  <div class="warning">
    <strong>Important:</strong> This is a training sensitivity, not a permanent setting.
    The idea is to temporarily exaggerate the opposite of your problem to train better
    motor control.
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Privacy:</strong> All recordings are stored locally on your computer.
    Nothing is ever uploaded.
  </div>

  <h2>Performance</h2>
  <p>Mouse tracking is optimized to have minimal impact on your system:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Recording doesn't affect your in-game sensitivity</li>
    <li>Minimal CPU and memory usage</li>
    <li>No impact on game performance</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Note:</strong> Mouse tracking is Windows-only due to platform-specific
    APIs.

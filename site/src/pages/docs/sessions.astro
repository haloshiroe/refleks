  <h2>What Are Sessions?</h2>
  <p>
    Sessions are groups of scenario runs based on timing. When you practice,
    RefleK's automatically groups consecutive runs into a single session, making
    it easy to review your training blocks.
  </p>

  </div>

  <h2>How Grouping Works</h2>
  <p>
    Runs are grouped based on a time gap (default: 20 minutes). If the gap
    between your last run and the next run is within this time, they're part of
    the same session. Take a longer break, and a new session starts.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Run at 10:00 AM → Session 1</li>
    <li>Run at 10:15 AM → Session 1 (15 min since last run)</li>
    <li>Run at 10:25 AM → Session 1 (10 min since last run)</li>
    <li>Run at 11:00 AM → Session 2 (35 min gap since last run)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Session Overview</h2>
  <p>Each session shows aggregated metrics and insights:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Summary stats:</strong> Total runs, time spent, average score and accuracy
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Performance charts:</strong> Score, accuracy, and TTK trends over the
      session
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Scenario mix:</strong> Visual breakdown of scenarios practiced
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Best and worst runs:</strong> Highlight your strongest and weakest performances
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Daily activity:</strong> See your training history at a glance
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Fatigue Detection</h2>
  <p>
    RefleK's monitors your performance during a session and alerts you when it
    detects signs of fatigue:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Declining scores over consecutive runs</li>
    <li>Decreasing accuracy trends</li>
    <li>Performance dropping below your session average</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When fatigue is detected, you'll see an alert suggesting it might be time
    for a break.
  </p>

  </div>

  <h2>Session Notes</h2>
  <p>
    Add notes to any session to record what you were working on, how you felt,
    or any insights:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Click on a session to view it</li>
    <li>Click the notes icon in the header</li>
    <li>Write your notes and save</li>
  </ol>
  <p>You can also rename sessions to give them meaningful titles.</p>

    <img
      src="/assets/images/session_notes.webp"
      alt="Session notes feature"
      loading="lazy"
    />
  </div>

  <h2>Filtering & Search</h2>
  <p>Find specific sessions using the filter and search options:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Search:</strong> Find sessions by scenario name, date, or session name
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Filter by run count:</strong> Show only sessions with a minimum number
      of runs
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>High scores:</strong> Filter to sessions containing personal bests
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Adjusting the Session Gap</h2>
  <p>You can change the session gap to match your practice style:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open Settings (gear icon)</li>
    <li>Go to General → Session Gap</li>
    <li>Set your preferred gap (e.g., 30 minutes for longer breaks)</li>
  </ol>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Tip:</strong> A shorter gap (5-10 min) is good for intense practice. A
    longer gap (30+ min) works better if you take frequent breaks.

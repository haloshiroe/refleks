## Development Setup

We recommend using the VS Code Dev Container to get started quickly without installing dependencies locally.

1.  **Dev Container:** Use the **Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command in VS Code.
2.  **Local Setup:** If you prefer local setup, you will need Go 1.23+, Node.js 18+, and the Wails v2 CLI.

### Running the App

- Run the "Wails: Dev" task in VS Code.
- Or run `wails dev` in the terminal.

### Building

- **Windows:** Run the "Wails: Build for Windows" task.
- **Host:** Run `wails build`.

## Pull Requests

- Please keep PRs focused and well-scoped.
- Ensure the app builds and runs before submitting.
- If you are adding a new feature, please consider opening an issue first to discuss it.
